Greetings newbies! Indeed, you are now facing the very first lab work for your CSE 15L course. I distinctly recall the horrors of ambiguity and the torture of enigma that I had to face my first very time. Oh, you don't want me to describe any of those to you. Instead, to help you on your grueling yet marvelous journey through this course, I have written this tutorial that shall guide you and keep you away from any diabolical bugs.

## Installing VScode

Installing VScode on your machine should be relatively straightforward. 

First, go to the Visual Studio Code [website](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and follow the instructions. There are versions for all the major operating systems, like OSX (for Macs) and Windows (for PCs). Make sure you download and install the correct version for your system. Follow the installation instructions and select the desired configuration. The default settings should work just well.

Second? Oh there is no secondâ€”you are good to go!

## Remotely Connecting

This could be the hardest part of the lab exercise, but, nevertheless, is pretty straightforward. 

If you are a windows user, then you have an additional step before you can proceed. Install [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) and set your default terminal to use the newly installed git bash in Visual Studio Code. To do the latter, you can make use of this post on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42606837/how-do-i-use-bash-on-windows-from-the-visual-studio-code-integrated-terminal/50527994#50527994). You are all ready now.

* Replace "zz" with the letters in your course-specific account in the following: "ssh cs15lwi23<ins>zz</ins>@ieng6.ucsd.edu". Then enter the resulting command in your bash terminal.
